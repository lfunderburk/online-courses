    "\n",
    "1. How has the number of deaths and births changed in Canada since 1946? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the average number of births and deaths for each province between 1946 and 2019?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does the ratio of births to deaths compare on any two given years?\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in learning how the number of births and deaths have changed over the course of the years. In this notebook, I assume the learner is comfortable with Jupyter notebooks and Python programming languages and can visualize line charts as well as pie charts. "

    "We learned that the ratio of deaths to births has changed over time. For instance, in 1946, the ratio of biths to deaths was about 2.9 . However, in 2019, this ratio changed to 1.3. If this ratio decreases in the upcoming years, the Canadian population could experience a decrease in population. "
